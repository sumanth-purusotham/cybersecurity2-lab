Summary:
This simulated phishing email impersonates PayPal using a spoofed sender address (support@paypall.com), urgent language, and a suspicious link. Technical analysis reveals SPF, DKIM, and DMARC failures, confirming the sender is unauthorized. The email also includes a fake HTML attachment likely used to steal credentials.

Key Indicators:
- Spoofed domain: paypall.com ≠ paypal.com

- Attachment: Account_Details.html (HTML phishing form)
- Language: “Verify within 24 hours or account will be suspended”
- Greeting: “Hi Customer” (generic)

Recommended Actions:
